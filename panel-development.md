# Panel Development

WHEREAS, Panel development is inaccessible to many due to it happening mostly behind closed doors,

WHEREAS, Panel development should be a collaborative effort from people across our organization to make this a successful project,

WHEREAS, Panel development decision making isn't democratic and doesn't allow for people to provide input in the direction of the project,

WHEREAS, a v2 rewrite is necessary to ensure the long-term codebase sustainability, fixing long-time bugs, adding long-promised features, and clean up technical debt,

THEREFORE IT BE RESOLVED, that the Panel working group ("the working group") shall be formed to oversee Panel development with regular meetings, open to all members to participate and help with the project. The working group shall have 1 chairperson elected by the members of the working group which shall serve terms of 1 year.
